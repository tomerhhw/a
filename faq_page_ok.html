                                    <p>Late Delivery/Non-Delivery: Our local florists and logistics team work diligently to make sure that your special gift arrives on time, within our normal delivery hours of 9AM to 8PM in the recipient's time zone. During our busy holiday periods like Christmas, Valentine's and Mother's Day, we may extend our delivery hours before 9AM and after 8PM to ensure that all gifts are delivered on time. If for any reason your gift does not arrive on time, our dedicated Customer Service agents will do everything they can to help successfully resolve your issue.
