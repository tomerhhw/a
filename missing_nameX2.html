  <p>Why should you shop locally?</p>
<p>Job Creation: Shops in our city create local employment and self-employment. These people in turn
  spend in the local community.</p>
<p>Sustainability: Travel to local business uses less fuel and helps to reduce our global footprint.</p>
<p>Local Investment: Local businesses are proportionately more generous in their support of local
  charities, schools and community events. Supporting local shops means a financial impact on
  your community.</p>
<p>Competition: A marketplace of thousands of small businesses is the best way to ensure innovation
  and low prices.</p>
<p>Local Economy: By supporting local business, you support the fabric of your community and
  simultaneously create more jobs, fund more City services through sales tax, invest in
  neighborhood improvement and promote community development.
