<p>ACIDS
Sourness is found naturally in many foods. Wines, vinegars and lemon juice are many of the common
  acids used in cooking. These are natural tenderizers and help break down foods by marinating.

ADJUST
In cooking "To Adjust" means to taste during cooking and add seasonings or flavorings, as needed.

AERATE
To pass dry ingredients through a fine-mesh sifter so large pieces can be removed. The process also
  incorporates air to make ingredients like flour, lighter. Sifting dry ingredients aerates them
  while distributing small amounts of chemical leaveners or dry seasoning evenly through the
  mixture. Use sifters, sieves or whisks to both aerate and sift.

AGED
In cooking "To Age" means to let food get older under controlled conditions. Aged Meat is usually
  stored 3 - 6 weeks at 34 - 38 degree's F. to allow the enzymes break down connective tissues.
  Aged Cheese is stored in a teperature controlled area until it develops the desired texture and
  flavor. Aged Wine is aged in both barrels and bottles. Red wine often benefits from longer aging.

AHI
The Hawaiian name for yellowfin or bigeye tuna. Often served raw or medium rare and used in sushi
  and sashimi.

AIOLI
A strong flavorful garlic mayonnaise mixture used for fish, meats and vegetables.

ALA
A French word for "in the style of", often used by region A la Carte means items are priced and
  ordered separately. A la mode means topped with ice cream.

AL DENTE
An Italian phrase meaning "to the tooth" used to describe pasta or foods that are cooked only to
  the point of doneness, often slightly underdone.

AMBROSIA
Greek Mythology refers to ambrosia as the food of the gods (translation is "immortality"). Also a
  dessert mixture of fruit served many ways, with or without gelatin.

AMUSE BOUCHE
A French phrase: A little bite of food to amuse the mouth and invigorate the palate. Many Chefs
  tantalize diners palates with decorative, intense flavored tastings to delight the eyes.

ANCHOVY
Small silvery fish that come from the Mediterranean, usually salt cured and canned in olive oil.
  These add great flavor to many foods!
